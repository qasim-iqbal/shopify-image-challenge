# shopify-image-challenge
This is a repository I made for Shopify Developer Intern Challenge Question (Summer 2021). The plan is to show a complete application using image repositories. Current idea is to go with AI/ Data science twist. Add other info later

# IDEAS:

- Search capability with image recognition
- -  searching images on text, and return relevant images back (could be used for product searching)
- try using docker
- some sort of UI, start with streamlit
