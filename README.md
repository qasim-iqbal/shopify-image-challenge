# shopify-image-challenge
This is a repository I made for Shopify developer intern challenge question (Summer 2021). It is a simple web app, which hosts a small repository of images and allows the user to search for images based on keywords as text or by uploading an image.


The website is a single page application, with a search bar to find specific images based on tags generated by YOLO v3 pretrained model. The search bar can take input in two ways either by comma seperated keywords such as "sheep, cow" or by uploading an image to server. To upload an image to server just drag and drop the image from you computer to the search bar area, the website will send image to server and get right tags back and seach for images similar to those. 


# Installation:
  The repository includes a docker file, just run it on your personal computer, Only the pretrained file is missing, which can be downloaded from this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10AaNPSRB9LVV5gNfevcEPUuwg4xkhK3O/view?usp=sharing), add this file to root folder next to app.py file. 

  Once the file is placed in directory make sure you have docker for desktop installed on your computer, If you have it then open up terminal or command prompt type commands below:
  - docker-compose build --no-cache
  - docker-compose up -d
  - docker-compose up
  
 It should start a server instance on port 5000, just go to your borwser window and type
  - http://localhost:5000
  
 It should load up a website with some images already in it, if not then just take some image from your local directory and drag and drop them on the search bar. Once image is dropped it will start uploading process and return images on server which match the image metadata.
  


# IDEAS for future:
  - Use NLP based word vectors on keywords and tags to find image matches even if they are not the same strings
  - Improve website UI
    - Make it an image gallery which connects to your local computer and allows you to search for images based many different criteria
  - Add openCV support to serach for images based on different factors such as colors, gemoetry etc..
