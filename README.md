# shopify-image-challenge
This is a repository I made for Shopify Developer Intern Challenge Question (Summer 2021). The plan is to show a complete application using image repositories. Current idea is to go with AI/ Data science twist. Add other info later

# IDEAS:

- Search capability with image recognition
- -  searching images on text, and return relevant images back (could be used for product searching)
- try using docker
- some sort of UI, start with streamlit 

# Docker:
- Add another seperate container for images, website and Image recognition, 
  link them all with volumes

- Initially try getting all working with one container

# GIT
- working version docker image will be provided
- model file will be removed from git, due to git file size limit
